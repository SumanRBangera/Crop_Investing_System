				<h6>SWEET CORN :</h6>
				<p>Sweet corn is an annual crop with yellow, white, or bi-colored ears. A long, frost-free growing season is necessary. Here’s how to plant, grow, and harvest corn in your garden.Sweet corn is wind-pollinated, so it should be planted in blocks, rather than in single rows. Early, mid, and late-season varieties extend the harvest, but be mindful: if you miss the optimal harvest time, the corn’s flavor will go downhill fast, as sugars convert to starch.</p>

						<td>Both white and yellow grain types of sweet corn are grown. Some of the recommended sweet corn varieties released for cultivation are Madhuri, Priya and Almora sweet corn in India.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Corn Colour:</th> 
						<td>Sweet corn comes in three colors: yellow, white and bicolour (yellow and white). Cross-pollination of yellow kernel varieties with white kernel varieties will result in production of bicolour corn. Also, if a bicolour is cross pollinated with a yellow variety, kernel colour will be predominantly yellow. Although there are geographical preferences for certain kernel colors, there is no relationship between colour and sweetness of sweet corn.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Yields:</th> 
						<td>If water requirements are met and other cultural practices optimized, sweet corn yields about 66000 ears per ha. High density planting can give higher number of harvested ears.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Pollination:</th> 
						<td>Unlike most vegetables, corn is wind pollinated and must be planted in blocks. Sweet corn of any type downwind from popcorn or field corn develops starchy kernels. Ears of supersweet sh-2 corn pollinated by a normal (su) sweet corn cultivar or a cultivar with the se gene will develop hard, ugly and starchy dent kernels. To avoid this cross¬pollination, different kernel types must be separated by at least 250 m or staggered planted so that they flower at least 14 days apart.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Packaging:</th> 
						<td>This is an excellent method of precooling sweet corn which is used for local, direct shipments. In this method, 7-10 Kg of crushed ice is distributed throughout the container (box or crate) during the packaging process. The amount of ice needed in a package depends on the temperatures of the corn at the time of packing and on the expected length of the marketing period. Typically about 500 g of ice for 2 Kg of sweet corn is sufficient. The main disadvantage is that if shipment to market is delayed, the package is heavy and wet.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Cold Storage:</th> 
						<td>To maintain best quality, sweet corn is placed in cold storage immediately after precooling. Storage can be in a refrigerated truck or in a room. Temperature is maintained as close to 0oC as possible without freezing the corn, and relative humidity of the air in the cold room at 95 percent or higher to keep the corn fresh. The corn is to be taken out as soon as possible since more than a few days in cold storage will decrease quality.</td>

		<div id="GINGER">
			<h6>GINGER :</h6>
			<p>Ginger plant looks slender like a reed which is 3-4 feet tall. The leaves are thin and green in color. The beauty of the plant is that it produces pink and white flower buds in clusters which bloom into yellow flowers. Some people use this plant for landscaping owing to this precise reason. When the stalk starts withering, crop is harvested and rhizomes are washed.</p>
			<table style="width:90%">
				<tr>
					<th>Climate:</th>
					<td>Ginger is cultivated at an altitude of 1500 meters above sea level in warm and humid climate. A moderate rainfall during sprouting time and a heavy, well-distributed rain at the time of growth is the most ideal situation for growing ginger. In case of absence of showers during sprouting period, the crop must be irrigated. The soil must stay moist so that sprouting happens. However, the weather must be dry before harvesting.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Season:</th>
					<td>Ideally, ginger can be cultivated following the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Along the western coasts of India, this happens during April and ginger can be cultivated here in the second week of May. However, in other parts of the country wherein the pre-monsoon showers are rare, it can be planted under irrigated conditions during the months of February and March.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Soil:</th>
					<td>Soil that has good drainage capacity such as clay loam, sandy loam, and red loam with rich humus content are good for ginger cultivation. It can also grow in lateritic soil which is well-drained. Sandy loam is however, the best for cultivation. Once harvested, it is not advisable to cultivate ginger in the same soil for a period of two years.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Crop Rotation:</th>
					<td>Ginger is an exhausting crop as it draws a huge amount of nutrients from the soil. Therefore, crop rotation is necessary. It is most commonly rotated with tapioca, maize, paddy, ragi and vegetables. It is also mixed with castor and red gram. In Kerala, it is grown as an inter-crop with arecanut, orange, coffee and coconuts. In case of crop rotation with vegetables, using potatoes, chillies, tomatoes, peanuts and brinjal must be avoided since they are hosts for Ralstonia solanacearum which is a wilt causing agent.</td>

			<h6>WATERMELON :</h6>
			<p>Watermelon is a warm, long-season crop and is now grown in all tropical and subtropical areas of the globe. This fruit mostly cultivated for its fresh juice and sweet flesh. Commercial cultivation of watermelon takes place on larger scale in summer season in most of the Asian countries. Watermelon belongs to the family of “cucurbitaceae” and genus of “citrullus”. Watermelons are native to the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa and the first recorded watermelon crop was found in Egypt. Farmers can make good profits from cultivation of watermelon, if proper cultivation methods and farm management practices are followed. Individual watermelon plants produce both male and female flowers. The fruit size varies from 2 to 15 kg, depending on variety. However, seedless varieties need pollinators. With the help of fruit shape retainers, farmers producing different shapes of watermelons which have great demand in the market. For example, in Japan, square shaped and love shaped watermelons are popular have great demand. China is top producer of watermelon in the world. Watermelon can be successfully grown in pots, containers, indoors, greenhouses and poly houses.</p>
			<table style="width:90%">
				<tr>
					<th>Climatic Condition:</th>
					<td>Watermelon is a warm season crop cultivated mainly in sub-tropical and hot-arid regions. Watermelons are sensitive to cold and even a mild frost can severely damage the crop and drastically reduce the yield. If these are grown in winter partial protection should be provided to protect from any frost conditions. The watermelon crop requires dry weather with full of sunshine for quality watermelon production. The best average temperature for watermelon production during the growing season is between 18°C and 35°C.Cool nights and warm days are ideal for accumulation of sugars in the fruits. The seed germinates best when temperatures are higher than 21°C. High humidity at the time of vegetative growth causes the watermelon crop susceptible to various fungal diseases. Temperatures above 36°C or below 10°C will slow the growth and maturation of the watermelon fruits.</td>

			<h6>SUGURCANE :</h6>
			<p>Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is the main sources of sugar in India and holds a prominent position as a cash crop. India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crop grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange.</p>
			<table style="width:90%">
				<tr>
					<th>Climate:</th>
					<td>Sugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and severe frost proves fatal. The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Soil:</th>
					<td>Sugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils. In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum (distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas.</td>

The general recommendation in most places is to apply half to two-thirds of the nitrogen in the form of bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, compost, green manure or tree leaves, and the remainder in the form of ammonium sulphate or oil-cakes or a combination of the two. For sugarcane fertilizer is recommended according to planting season and it is varied from growing tract to tract. In general for suru sugarcane 250:115:115 for Adsali 400:170:170 and for pre seasonal 340:170:170 kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended respectively.
